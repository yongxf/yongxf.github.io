<p>Welcome!</p>
<p>This page supplements our ICRA paper submission, in which we present a learning framework to plan robust grasps for bin picking with customized grippers. The framework contains an optimization-based planner by iterative surface fitting (ISF), and a learning-based explorer by regions with convolutional neural network (R-CNN). </p>
<p>Customized grippers have specifically designed fingers to increase the contact area with the workpieces and improve the grasp robustness. However, grasp planning for customized grippers is challenging due to the object variations, surface contacts and structural constraints of the grippers. In this paper, we propose a learning framework to plan robust grasps for customized grippers in real-time. The learning framework contains a low-level optimization-based planner to search for optimal grasps locally under object shape variations, and a high-level learning-based explorer to learn the grasp exploration based on previous grasp experience. The optimization-based planner uses an iterative surface fitting (ISF) to simultaneously search for optimal gripper transformation and finger displacement by minimizing the surface fitting error. The high-level learning-based explorer trains a regionbased convolutional neural network (R-CNN) to propose good optimization regions, which avoids ISF getting stuck in bad
local optima and improves the collision avoidance performance. The proposed learning framework with RCNN-ISF is able to consider the structural constraints of the gripper, learn grasp exploration strategy from previous experience, and plan optimal grasps in clutter environment in real-time. The effectiveness of the algorithm is verified by experiments.</p>

<h3>Experimental Results by RCNN-ISF</h3>
<h3>Light Clutter Environment</h3>
<p>The R-CNN behaves similar with baseline initialization using K-means clustering in clean environment, as shown in below video. </p>

<h3>Heavy Clutter Environment</h3>
<p>As the point cloud getting more complicated, the ISF initialization by K-means clustering becomes less-efficient. </p>

<p>Video: Inefficiency of the ISF search by K-means Cluttering. The K-means cluttering restricts the searching on discrete, isolated points, which is not sufficient to explore large point cloud. 
<br /></p>
<p>In this paper, we utilize R-CNN to learn the good regions to initilize ISF search from previous grasping experience. </p>

<h2>Failure Mode</h2>
<p>Point to plane fitting error may not be the best metric when choosing the optimal grasp from multiple feasible grasps.</p>
